# Hi, I'm Ukpai (Aimes) 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

Positive and self-disciplined Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience developing user-friendly and pixel-perfect software products. I am well-versed in Node, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience building single-page web applications using Next, Gatsby, and React.
I have worked remotely on a couple of projects with groups of people from various backgrounds, which has given me the opportunity to strengthen my skills. I have gained the maturity and technical expertise required to work on any software project.
